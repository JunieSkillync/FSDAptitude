 # Number Systems Practice Set

 ## 1. Of the three numbers second is twice the first and is also thrice the third.If the average of the three numbers is 44.Find the largest number

 ```Apt

  Ans  = 72
  Let the third number be x. Then second number = 3x. First number=3x/2.Therefore x+3x+3x/2=44*3 or x=24 So largest number= 2nd number=3x=72.

 ```

## 2. Three times the first of the consecutive three odd numbers is 3 more than twice the third. The third integer is.

```Apt
Ans = 15

Let the three integers be x, x + 2 and x+4 Then, 3x = 2 (x+4) + 3 ⇔x=11.
∴ Third integer = x + 4 = 15

```

## 3. Find four consecutive even integers so that the sum of the first two added to twice the sum of the last two is equal to 742

```Apt
Ans : 120, 122, 124, 126

Solution

Here let the four even integers be x, x+2, x+4 and x+6 then the equation as per the question will be,
x+x+2+2(x+4+x+6) = 742
2x+2+2(2x+10) = 742
2x+2+4x+20 = 742
6x+22 = 742
6x = 720
x = 120​
 

Now, the four consecutive even integers are
x=120
x+2=122
x+4=124
x+6=126
